## üìä What is Descriptive Analysis?

**Descriptive analysis** is a fundamental step in data analysis aimed at **summarizing, organizing, and visualizing data clearly and objectively**. Instead of explaining causes or predicting future outcomes, it focuses on **understanding what is currently happening** based on the available data.

This analysis helps answer questions like:
- What are the average, maximum, and minimum values?
- What is the distribution of the data?
- Are there visible patterns, trends, or anomalies?
- Which variables are most correlated?

## ‚úÖ Why is Descriptive Analysis Important?

- **Essential first step**: Before applying statistical models or machine learning algorithms, it is crucial to understand the data.
- **Problem identification**: Helps detect missing data, outliers, and inconsistencies.
- **Effective communication**: Summarizes large volumes of information in simple tables, charts, and metrics, making it easier for different business areas to understand.
- **Decision-making support**: Provides initial insights that support quick, informed decisions‚Äîeven without predictive analysis.
- **Guides deeper analysis**: Helps define next steps, such as segmentations, hypotheses, or modeling.

### ‚úèÔ∏è Common Techniques:

- Measures of central tendency: mean, median, and mode
- Measures of dispersion: standard deviation, variance, and interquartile range
- Frequency tables and cross-tabulations
- Charts: histograms, boxplots, scatterplots, heatmaps
- Correlation analysis between variables

#### Beyond the creation of the descriptive notebook, I have created also a dashboard on looker studio: [Dashboard](https://lookerstudio.google.com/reporting/8a345345-a78e-49dc-9fa4-b8225b1a1ea1)
